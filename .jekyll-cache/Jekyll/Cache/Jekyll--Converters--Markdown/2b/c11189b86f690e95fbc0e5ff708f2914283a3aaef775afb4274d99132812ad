I"%L<p>My last post on <a href="2019-12-16-handle-secrets-in-bc.md">Handling Secrets</a> started quite a few discussions. Which is good. Very good. We need to start thinking about security. Like I already said we are not playing in our on-premise backyard anymore where an administrator will keep us save and secure. We entered a world where we working with connected systems. For now the number is probably quite small and handleable but if you ask my for my opinion this numbers will go up. We are working towards a mesh of smaller and bigger distributed services. The majority of them will be publicly in the internet and secured the one way or the other. If you try to categorize these discussions there have been three main subjects of discussion. First how we can initialize the secrets - The subject of this blog post -. The other subjects have been mechanisms for authenticating and how to manage services like Azure Function. I probably will do posts about them in the future as well. But for now let us stick with initializing the secrets.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>Well, a TL;DR is really hard this time. I show how you get around an initial secret and keep the secret separate from your code. But I basically use a add-in for getting a customer on you website and register. The code for the whole example can be found <a href="https://github.com/NAVRockClimber/ALInitSecrectsExample" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ready-player-one">Ready player one</h2>

<p>One of the first answers to my tweet about my blog entry have been that there would be no way to ship an app without an secret somewhere inside the app. Well, actually there is. That was what I meant with an onboarding process in my last post. But I get the point of the author. It is the quick way. But as we all know, the quick way bites us in the ass one day and we are joining the dark side. Well, I got to admit the other way is quite a piece of work. So let us stay on the path to the dark side for a moment.
What he probably meant was that we somehow need to get an initial secret shipped. We lack the possibility of reaching the customer and tell him the secret when he downloads our extension from the app source. If we somehow could get notified by Microsoft this would be awesome. In my dreams Microsoft would provide us with the ability to register a webhook and every time our app gets installed we would get notified with some kind of unique identifier and mail address for the customer. When the webhook is invoked we could create an key and send the customer an e-mail with his initial credentials.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-a-secret">Requirements for a secret</h2>

<p>Before we dive deeper into the dark path let us first define a few requirements towards secrets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy changeable</li>
  <li>easy updateable</li>
  <li>easy revocable</li>
  <li>unique per customer</li>
  <li>separate from code</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, you hopefully agree that these 5 bullet points are mostly non-negotiable requirements.</p>

<h2 id="the-dark-path">The dark path</h2>

<p>Unfortunately Microsoft does not provide us with the possibility of a webhook, yet. So let us be soft on the last point of our list and put at least an initial secret in the code. Due to this is configuration data the best fitting place would be the installer codeunit. I don’t really like the idea because we are mixing code and configuration data again. But, if there is some place where you could put it then there. So, I extended the sample from my last blog post by the last line and a label. You find it <a href="https://github.com/NAVRockClimber/AlSecrectsExample/blob/DirtyInit/SecretsHelper.codeunit.al" target="_blank">here on github</a>.</p>

<span class="k">end</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Et voila, we initialized the secret during setup. It is stored via a helper codeunit in the isolated storage. But, let us check it against our list. We still can change it, we can update it and we can revoke it. But, we cannot inform our customer about any of these changes. Unfortunately it is also not unique per customer and separate from code. You can now see where the problem is with secrets. We need some kind of process around them. This is what I mean with the need for an onboarding process. The simple fact of being able to change or revoke a key is simply not sufficient. We need a something around it and that is what I meant with an onboarding process.</p>

<h2 id="theoretical-solution">Theoretical solution</h2>

<p>There we are. We initialized the secret but if we want to change it we still got a problem. We cannot change it because we cannot inform the anybody about it. But our problem is only half a technical problem. And, we only thought about ourselves. We need to have our customers in mind as well. If we take the customers position we recognize that we have to adjust the requirements a little bit. Let us assume the customers have to pay per usage for our services. Now the person with access to the keys leaves the company. Maybe he even leaves to a competitor. The customer probably won’t like the idea that he still is able to access out services and want to change the keys.</p>

<ul>
  <li>easy changeable (for ISV and Customer)</li>
  <li>easy updateable (for ISV and Customer)</li>
  <li>easy revocable (for ISV and Customer)</li>
  <li>unique per customer</li>
  <li>separate from code</li>
</ul>

<p>If we now look at the requirement we recognize we have a lot more to do. We need a website or portal where the customer can log in and request a new key.
But how do we get our customer on our website?</p>

<h2 id="the-righteous-path">The righteous path</h2>

<p>Well, let us leave the dark side and return back onto the good side of the force. We still did not solve our initial problem in a satisfying way. I thought quite a while on how we can solve this issue. I solved it with the mighty force of JavaScript. Unfortunately JavaScript is not my strong suit. So, I beg you to show mercy with me if you find something ugly in it. And, yes it probably can look nicer but I am not really blessed with designer skills as well.</p>

<p><img src="/static/assets/img/blog/InitSecrets/JSAddin.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>I like this variant much more. Let us present a nice text and a link you can follow by clicking. Maybe you can pimp it with your company’s logo and more stuff that comes to your mind. But this is just a proof of concept.</p>

<h2 id="the-force-of-js-is-mighty-in-bc">The force of JS is mighty in BC</h2>

<p>Ok let me show you the magic. The JavaScript in behind is actually quite simple. I defined an interface or a controladdin in AL that is quite simple. The add-in get a text and a link and displays it.</p>

<p>Also the JavaScript is quite simple. In its core it consists only of two functions.</p>

<p>The Show function is the one invoked from a page holding the add-in. Now we just create a paragraph section for the text and a hyperlink. At the end we get the add-in element and attach both as children. All that’s left than is to implement the onclick function and open the link in a new window.</p>

<p>Now we just need to show the add-in. For demo purposes I check if BC can retrieve a secret from my isolated storage and if not I present a page with the add-in. There might be better ways but it help making my pint clear.</p>

<p>If the isolated storage does not contain a secret with the corresponding key we call the InitSecret function and the page is shown.</p>

<p>As always you can find the whole code for the example on <a href="https://github.com/NAVRockClimber/ALInitSecrectsExample" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>

<p><em>Edit: An idea that struck me after I finished this post was that we could insert an e-mail address in the add-in and send a mail for allowing the customer to register. We could put additional information in the mail like some kind of unique identifier. But it is only an idea for now and still needs a bit of research.</em></p>
